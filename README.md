Are you developing a sensitive API where calling the same endpoint twice can cause catastrophy? ðŸ’¥

Here's how Stripe handles it:
- https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency
- https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests

If you said "oh yes, that's smart" then read on. Because we implemented that for Laravel.

## Features

- Apply it to a single route, or apply to your whole API...
- Works only for POST requests. Other endpoints are ignored.
- Smart enough to verify path + headers + body is identical before returning the response.
- Will record and play back 2xx and 5xx responses, without touching your controller again.
- Doesn't remember the response if there was a valiation error (4xx). So it's safe to retry.
- Prevents race conditions using Laravel's support for cache locks.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require swiftmade/idempotent
```

## Use

1. The client must pass the following header:

```
Idempotency-Key: --uuid or any other random string---
```

2. The server will check the key. If a matching response is already cached, exactly that response will be returned.

You can know that the response is a playback from the response headers:

```
Is-Playback: --the key you passed--
```

3. If you get back status `400`, it means the following request was not identical with the cached one. Just use another idempotency key, if you mean to execute a fresh request.

4. If you get back status `425`, it means you retried too fast. It's perfectly safe to try again later.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
