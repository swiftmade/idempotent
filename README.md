Are you developing a sensitive API where calling the same endpoint twice can cause catastrophy? ðŸ’¥

Here's how Stripe handles it:
- https://stripe.com/blog/idempotency
- https://stripe.com/docs/api/idempotent_requests

If you said "oh yes, that's smart" then read on. Because we implemented that for Laravel.

## Features

- Apply it to a single route, or apply to your whole API...
- Works only for POST requests. Other endpoints are ignored.
- Smart enough to verify path + headers + body is identical before returning the response.
- Will record and play back 2xx and 5xx responses, without touching your controller again.
- Doesn't remember the response if there was a validation error (4xx). So it's safe to retry.
- Prevents race conditions using Laravel's support for cache locks.


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require swiftmade/playback
```

To customize the configuration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Swiftmade\Playback\PlaybackServiceProvider"
```

ðŸš¨ Important

Open `config/cache.php` and add a new item to the `stores`Â array.

```php
'stores' => [
    // ... other stores
    'playback' => [
        'driver' => 'redis',
        // We strongly recommend using a different
        // connection (another redis DB) in production.
        'connection' => 'cache',
    ],
]
```

## Use

1. The client must supply a idempotency key. Otherwise, the middleware won't execute.

```
Idempotency-Key: preferrably uuid4, but anything flies
```

2. The server will look the key up. If there's a match, exactly that response will be returned.

You can know that the response is a playback from the response headers:

```
Is-Playback: your idempotency key
```

3. If you get back status `400`, it means the following request was not identical with the cached one. Just use another idempotency key, if you mean to execute a fresh request.

4. If you get back status `425`, it means you retried too fast. It's perfectly safe to try again later.

### Testing

``` bash
composer test
```
